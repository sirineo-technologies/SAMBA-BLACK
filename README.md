# SAMBA-BLACK
SAMBA BLACK is a multi-protocol IoT adapter shield developed by SiriNEO Technologies, for coupling in 16-channel relay modules, in it peripherals such as IR receiver and input for 02 (two) IR emitters were inserted, in addition to having activation of channels of 12 VDC/DC relay. This hardware also provides the user with the possibility to work directly with the xbee socket modules coupled to the hardware. Modules such as Xbee (DIGI), ZigBOT Zigbee3 (SiriNEO Technologies), WROOMBEE (EngeBOT), LORABOT (EngeBOT) and SIGBOT (EngeBOT) can be used with facilities in this hardware. They can operate with the peripherals of this shield: light sensor, potentiometer, temperature sensor, LEDs, push buttons and relays through the configuration of their pins directly coupled to the hardware. SAMBA BLACK was designed for automation of lamps and switches, aquariums and aquaponics systems. Our intention in this project was to bring to the market a hardware, a simple hardware solution capable of integrating multiple solutions for the IoT, through IoT protocol modules developed by EngeBOT Tecnologia and others existing in the world market.
